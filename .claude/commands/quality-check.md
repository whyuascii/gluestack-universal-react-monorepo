Run a full quality check on the monorepo.

Execute these commands and report results:

1. `pnpm typecheck` — Type safety across all packages
2. `pnpm lint` — Code style and best practices
3. `pnpm test` — All test suites

For each step, report: pass/fail, error count, and specific issues found.

If any step fails, suggest fixes but do NOT apply them unless I ask.
